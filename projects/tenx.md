title: 10X Genomics

I have been at [10X Genomics](http://www.10xgenomics.com) since October 2014, when we were still stealth. My projects have been primarily on the DNA sequencing platform using molecular barcodes attached in emulsion to add long range genetic information to short read nextgen sequencing.

### PHASING LONG MOLECULES

The 10X platform can also be used for DNA sequencing. Instead of single cells, the sample is partitioned into long molecules (mean ~50kb and up to ~250kb), which are used to produce short reads with a barcode denoting the molecule of origin. The barcodes allow downstream analyses to "link" reads together according to their source molecules. Linked reads provide useful long-range information that can disambiguate between homologous regions and enable haplotype phasing across large chunks of chromosomes.

I’ve made significant contributions to the development of [Long Ranger](http://support.10xgenomics.com/genome-exome/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-long-ranger), our pipeline for analyzing 10X genome and exome data. I’ve also contributed to the design and analysis of a custom exome bait set that takes advantage of linked reads to improve phasing of genes.
